# PhoenixFeatureBasedApp

To start this Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Tests

For this app, the tests are in the same folders as the code.
The `mix.exs` file has been setup to run these tests,
so the file `test_helper.exs` must be in the `lib` folder.
